## Things you just **DO NOT** ask

> In the United States, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
> (EEOC) enforces laws that make it illegal to ask job candidates
> questions about their race, color, sex (including gender identity,
> sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or
> older), disability, or genetic information. Staying clear of these
> topics isn't just a legal requirement; it's also good practice to
> foster a fair and inclusive hiring process. If the job requires
> specific criteria like the ability to lift certain weights, or work
> specific hours, the questions should be framed around the candidate's
> ability to meet the job requirements, not their personal
> characteristics or status.

## Code Security Questions

### 1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

Provide a code snippet in C# with a potential XSS vulnerability (e.g., a JavaScript input echoed directly into an HTML response). Ask the candidate to identify the vulnerability and suggest a fix.

```csharp
string userProvidedInput = "<script>alert('XSS');</script>";
string output = "<div>" + userProvidedInput + "</div>";
// Ask the candidate to identify the XSS vulnerability and suggest a fix.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet is vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) because it directly inserts user input into the HTML response. To fix this, we should use proper HTML encoding for the user input before including it in the HTML response.

```csharp
string userProvidedInput = "<script>alert('XSS');</script>";
string encodedInput = System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(userProvidedInput);
string output = "<div>" + encodedInput + "</div>";
```

### 2. **SQL Injection**

Present a C# code example where user input is directly concatenated into a SQL query. Ask the candidate to identify the vulnerability and recommend a secure way to handle user input in SQL queries.

```csharp
string userInput = "John'; DROP TABLE Users;--";
string query = "SELECT-FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + userInput + "'";
// Ask the candidate to identify the SQL injection vulnerability and recommend a secure way to handle user input in SQL queries.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection because user input is directly included in the SQL query. To mitigate this, we should use parameterized queries or an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework like Entity Framework to handle user input securely.

```csharp
string userInput = "John'; DROP TABLE Users;--";
using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
connection.Open();
using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT-FROM Users WHERE Username = @Username", connection))
{
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Username", userInput);
// Execute the query securely
}
}
```

### 3. **Authentication and Authorization in C#**

Show a piece of C# code related to user authentication or authorization. Ask the candidate to review it for security weaknesses and propose improvements.

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public IActionResult AdminDashboard()
{
// Code for the admin dashboard
}
// Ask the candidate to review the authorization logic for security weaknesses and propose improvements.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet applies an authorization attribute to an admin dashboard, which is a good practice. However, it's important to ensure that the authentication and authorization mechanisms are correctly implemented elsewhere in the application to prevent unauthorized access.

### 4. **Input Validation and Sanitization in C#**

Give a C# code snippet that receives user input and processes it. Ask the candidate to identify if input validation and sanitization are performed correctly, and suggest any necessary changes.

```csharp
string userInput = "UserInput123";
bool isInputValid = userInput.All(char.IsLetterOrDigit);
// Ask the candidate to identify if input validation and sanitization are performed correctly and suggest any necessary changes.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet performs basic input validation by checking if the input consists of alphanumeric characters. While this is a good start, it's important to consider the specific validation requirements for the input data. Additionally, it's a good practice to sanitize the input (e.g., remove potentially harmful characters) before using it in further processing.

### 5. **API Security in C#**

Share C# code related to an API endpoint. Ask the candidate to assess the security of the API, including authentication, authorization, and potential vulnerabilities.

```csharp
[HttpGet("api/data")]
[Authorize]
public IActionResult GetSecureData()
{
// Code to retrieve secure data
}
// Ask the candidate to assess the security of the API, including authentication and authorization.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet appears to be an API endpoint that requires authentication using the `[Authorize]` attribute. However, to ensure security, it's important to review the configuration of authentication and authorization providers and consider implementing other security headers, such as rate limiting and content security policies, depending on the application's requirements.

### 6. **File Uploads in C#**

Provide C# code for handling file uploads. Ask the candidate to identify potential security risks related to file uploads and suggest measures to mitigate these risks.

```csharp
[HttpPost("api/upload")]
[Authorize]
public IActionResult UploadFile(IFormFile file)
{
// Code to handle file uploads
}
// Ask the candidate to identify potential security risks related to file uploads and suggest measures to mitigate these risks.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet handles file uploads, but it should include additional security checks. Potential security risks include file type validation, checking file size limits, and ensuring that uploaded files cannot be executed as code (e.g., by renaming files with unsafe extensions). Implementing these checks can enhance the security of the file upload functionality.

### 7. **Authentication Bypass in C#**

Present C# code that implements authentication logic. Ask the candidate to identify any potential authentication bypass vulnerabilities and propose fixes.

```csharp
if (userInput == "admin" && password == "password123")
{
// Grant admin access
}
// Ask the candidate to identify any potential authentication bypass vulnerabilities and propose fixes.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet is vulnerable to a simple authentication bypass because it relies on hard-coded values for authentication. To enhance security, it's important to use secure authentication mechanisms, such as password hashing and salting, and to avoid storing sensitive information like passwords in plain text.

```csharp
// Implement a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., using ASP.NET Core Identity)
var user = _userManager.FindByNameAsync(username);
if (user != null && _userManager.CheckPasswordAsync(user, password))
{
// Grant access
}
```

### 8. **Session Management in C#**

Show C# code that manages user sessions. Ask the candidate to review it for security issues, such as session fixation or insufficient session timeout settings.

```csharp
services.AddSession(options =>
{
options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
});
// Ask the candidate to review session management settings for security issues, such as session fixation or insufficient session timeout settings.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet configures session management with an idle timeout of 30 minutes, which is a reasonable setting. However, it's important to ensure that session tokens are securely generated and that sessions are properly invalidated upon logout or other events to prevent session fixation attacks.

### 9. **Error Handling in C#**

Share C# code that handles errors in the application. Ask the candidate to assess error handling practices and suggest improvements, including avoiding the exposure of sensitive information.

```csharp
try
{
// Code that may throw exceptions
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
// Log and handle the exception
}
// Ask the candidate to assess error handling practices and suggest improvements, including avoiding the exposure of sensitive information.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet captures and logs exceptions, which is a good practice for error handling. However, it's important to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages that could be displayed to users. Error messages should be informative to developers but not reveal details that could aid attackers.

### 10. **Data Protection in C#**

Present C# code that handles sensitive data (e.g., passwords or credit card numbers). Ask the candidate to review it for data protection measures, such as encryption and hashing.

```csharp
string sensitiveData = "SecretPassword123";
byte[] encryptedData = ProtectedData.Protect(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sensitiveData), null, DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser);
// Ask the candidate to review data protection measures, such as encryption, and hashing.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet uses `ProtectedData.Protect` to encrypt sensitive data, which is a good practice. However, it's important to ensure that encryption keys are securely managed, and sensitive data should be hashed before storage to enhance security further.

### 11. **API Rate Limiting and Security Headers in C#**

Show C# code related to API rate limiting and security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy). Ask the candidate to assess if these are implemented correctly for security purposes.

```csharp
[HttpGet("api/data")]
[Authorize]
[ResponseCache(Duration = 60)]
[ContentSecurityPolicy("default-src 'self'")]
public IActionResult GetSecureData()
{
// Code to retrieve secure data
}
// Ask the candidate to assess if API rate limiting and security headers are implemented correctly for security purposes.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet includes rate limiting with `[ResponseCache]` and a Content Security Policy (CSP) header with `[ContentSecurityPolicy]`, which are good security practices. However, the specific CSP policy should be tailored to the application's requirements, and other security headers like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) may also be considered.

### 12. **Secure Coding Practices in C#**

Provide C# code that contains potential security flaws related to buffer overflows, insecure deserialization, or other common security issues. Ask the candidate to identify these issues and suggest secure coding practices.

```csharp
// Example of a potentially insecure code snippet with buffer overflow vulnerability
int[] numbers = new int[10];
int index = 15;
int value = numbers[index];
// Ask the candidate to identify security flaws (e.g., buffer overflow) and suggest secure coding practices.
```

**Possible Answer**: The code snippet has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to accessing an array element with an out-of-bounds index. To prevent this, bounds checking should be performed before accessing array elements, and safer data structures like lists should be considered.

```csharp
List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
int index = 15;
if (index >= 0 && index < numbers.Count)
{
int value = numbers[index];
}
```

### 13. **Code Reviews in C#**

Give the candidate a hypothetical scenario where they need to conduct a security code review of a pull request for C# code. Ask them to describe their approach and what they would look for during the review.

**Hypothetical scenario**: Provide a description of a security code review scenario for C# code, such as reviewing a pull request for an authentication module. Ask the candidate to describe their approach to the review and what specific security aspects they would look for.

**Possible Answer**: In a security code review, I would follow a systematic approach to assess the security of the code. Here are the key aspects I would consider:

- Authentication and Authorization I would verify that authentication and authorization mechanisms are correctly implemented, including the use of secure password storage, proper role-based access control, and protection against unauthorized access.
- Input Validation and Sanitization I would check if user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.
- Data Protection I would ensure that sensitive data is appropriately encrypted and hashed before storage and that encryption keys are securely managed.
- Error Handling I would review error handling practices to make sure that sensitive information is not exposed in error messages and that exceptions are properly logged and handled.
- API Security I would assess the security of APIs, including rate limiting, security headers, and proper authorization for API endpoints.
- Secure Coding Practices I would look for common security issues such as buffer overflows, insecure deserialization, and other code vulnerabilities, and recommend secure coding practices to mitigate them.
- Third-Party Components I would assess the security of third-party libraries

### 14. **Security Libraries and Frameworks in C#**

Ask the candidate if they have experience using security libraries or frameworks in C# (e.g., ASP.NET Core Identity, OWASP .NET Security Cheat Sheet) and to explain how they would use them to enhance code security.

```csharp
// Example of using ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication and authorization
services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>()
.AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()
.AddDefaultTokenProviders();
// Ask the candidate if they have experience using security libraries like ASP.NET Core Identity and how they would use them to enhance code security.
```

**Possible Answer**: Yes, I have experience using security libraries and frameworks like ASP.NET Core Identity to enhance code security. ASP.NET Core Identity is a powerful library for managing user authentication and authorization.

- Authentication I would configure ASP.NET Core Identity to handle user authentication securely. This includes options for password hashing and salting, multi-factor authentication, and user account lockout policies to protect against brute force attacks.
- Authorization I would use ASP.NET Core Identity's role-based authorization to control access to different parts of the application. It allows fine-grained control over who can perform specific actions within the application.
- Security Token Management ASP.NET Core Identity provides mechanisms for managing security tokens, which can be used for actions like email confirmation and password reset. I would ensure that these tokens are generated securely and have a limited lifespan to prevent misuse.
- User Management I would use the built-in features of ASP.NET Core Identity for user management, including account creation, password recovery, and account locking.
- Customization ASP.NET Core Identity is highly customizable, allowing me to adapt it to the specific security requirements of the application. I can customize user properties, authentication providers, and more.

In addition to ASP.NET Core Identity, I would also reference the OWASP .NET Security Cheat Sheet and follow best practices recommended by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to address common security issues like XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF.

### 15. **Handling Third-Party Components in C#**

Present C# code that uses third-party libraries or components. Ask the candidate to assess the security of these components and recommend best practices for keeping them updated and secure.

```csharp
// Example of using a third-party JSON parsing library
using Newtonsoft.Json;

string json = "{\"name\":\"John\",\"age\":30}";
var person = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Person>(json);
// Ask the candidate to assess the security of these third-party components and recommend best practices for keeping them updated and secure.
```

**Possible Answer**: When using third-party components in C# applications, it's crucial to assess their security and follow best practices for keeping them updated and secure.

- Security Assessment I would begin by conducting a security assessment of the third-party component. This involves reviewing its documentation, release notes, and any known security vulnerabilities or advisories. I would also consider the reputation and trustworthiness of the component's maintainers.
